# Mern-Project
Movie Time is for reservation tickets for cinema, the home page shows all movies and their show time and date at the cinema so the user can book a ticket.
and we have admin pages the admin can add movies and see the ticket bookers information so when they pay for the tickets he can check them as paid.
We used many technologies in order to complete the project like Trello, Zoom ,Github....
